            <p>Over the past decades, the question of <mentioned>what text really is</mentioned> has

               If there is one thing that, taken together, those contributions illustrate, it is
               that our understanding of text is – and has been – constantly in flux and open for
               many interpretations. This flexible and heterogeneous understanding of text is
               reflected by the TEI Guidelines: users can mix modules and elements in order to come
               to their encoding model of choice. As a result, most encoding models are based on a
               scholar conceptual understanding of a text and their research interest in a text.
               Still, there often are significant gaps between how a scholar conceptually thinks
               about text, how this translates to an encoding model, and how a computer understands

            <p>In the present contribution, we illustrate how the Text-As-Graph (TAG) hypergraph
               data model and the associated syntax TAGML can be employed to express and store
               textual features in a way that corresponds more closely with the scholar’s
               understanding of it. TAG’s functional design is based on the objective to reconcile
               the conceptual model, the encoding model and the informational model. The
               expressiveness of the syntax TAGML allows scholars to digitally represent their
               understanding of a text in a more explicit and formal manner. This information is
               then stored in the hypergraph data model for text. Consequently, a TAGML processor
               will not require any application layer in order for the text to be processed,
               queried, and analysed as it is intended and understood by the encoder. Finally, TAG’s
               approach will also promote the sustainability, archivability, and reuse of the text

            <p>Over the past decades, the question of <mentioned>what text really is</mentioned> has
               been addressed by a large number of conferences, workshops, articles, and blog posts.
               If there is one thing that, taken together, those contributions illustrate, it is
               that our understanding of text is – and has been – constantly in flux and open for
               many interpretations. This flexible and heterogeneous understanding of text is
               reflected by the TEI Guidelines: users can mix modules and elements in order to come
               to their encoding model of choice. As a result, most encoding models are based on a
               scholar conceptual understanding of a text and their research interest in a text.
               Still, there often are significant gaps between how a scholar conceptually thinks
               about text, how this translates to an encoding model, and how a computer understands
               the encoded text. Put differently: how an encoding looks to a human reader often
               differs from the way that information is stored on a computer.</p>
            <p>A clear example of this lack of congruence is seen with what we call <term
                  xml:id="nonlinear">non-linear text</term>, a textual phenomenon often present on
               historical or literary documents in the form of deletions and additions. We consider
               text to be non-linear when there is more than one order in which words or characters
               may be placed without influencing the semantics of the text. A straightforward
               example is the sentence <eg>This is a <hi rend="strike-out">first</hi>
                  <hi rend="addition">second</hi> attempt.</eg> From the perspective of a human
               reader, the deleted and the added word represent two readings of the character
               sequence. The deleted and the added word are located at the same position in the text
               sequence and they are mutually exclusive: reading from left to right, the sentence
               either says <eg>this is a first attempt</eg> or <eg>this is a second attempt</eg>. We
               say that the text characters are <term>fully ordered</term> until the point where the
               variation occurs (at the crossed-out word <q>first</q>). At this point, the text
               characters are <term>unordered</term>. The two reading paths converge again after the
               variation ends, so the text characters are again fully ordered after the addition. We
               therefore also call non-linear text <term>partially ordered text</term>.</p>
            <p>From an informational perspective, however, the partially-orderedness as perceived by
               a human reader is not represented as such in the underlying data model. In TEI XML,
               partially ordered text may be encoded like this: <egXML
                  xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><s>This is a
                        <del>first</del><add>second</add> attempt.</s></egXML> As human readers, we
               assume that if the <gi>del</gi> and <gi>add</gi> elements were to be placed in a
               different order, they would not have the same meaning (see <ref type="bibl"
                  target="#dekk2017">Haentjens Dekker and Birnbaum</ref>and <ref type="bibl"
                  target="#dekk2018">Haentjens Dekker et al.</ref>). However, in XML, all text and
               markup are typically ordered.<note>Only XML attributes and XML attribute values are
                  unordered.</note> In order for an XML processor to understand that the markup
               element <gi>subst</gi> expresses the start of partially ordered text, it needs to
               have access to an application layer like a schema that explains the semantic meaning
               of the markup tag. The more responsibility is delegated to additional application
               layers, the more complex the processing of the XML document becomes.<note>See also
                     <ref type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref1" target="#sper2008">Sperberg-McQueen and
                     Huitfeldt</ref>, who point out that any mechanisms defined by the TEI to
                  express textual features like discontinuity are not understood or supported by
                  generic XML tools; <quote source="#quoteref1">they require vocabulary-specific
                     support by a different layer of code</quote>, and by <ref target="#per2009"
                     type="bibl" xml:id="quoteref2">Peroni and Vitali</ref> who state that a TEI XML
                  document with specific markup that requires to be <quote source="#quoteref2"
                     >understood and exploited by a very specific and application-dependent
                     tool</quote> defeats the purpose of switching to XML in the first place. This
                  line of reasoning reflects the software development principle of Separation of
                  Concerns, which sets out to decrease complexity, promote sustainable development,
                  and facilitate the maintenance of code.</note> Ideally, therefore, one likes to
               avoid depending on the application layer(s) for TEI XML documents to be processed in
               accordance with a scholar’s expectations. That means information about non-linearity
               and other alternative text structures or orderings should be part of the data model
               and not the application layer(s). Once a data model is able to represent and store as
               many properties of a text as possible, the application layer(s) do(es) not need to
               supplement the model and can focus on actual application-level tasks instead (<ref
                  type="bibl" target="#dekk2017">Haentjens Dekker and Birnnaum</ref>).</p>
            <p>In the present contribution, we illustrate this line of reasoning argument with the
                  <ref target="https://huygensing.github.io/TAG/">Text-As-Graph (TAG)</ref>
               hypergraph data model and the associated syntax <ref
                  target="https://github.com/HuygensING/TAG/tree/master/TAGML">TAGML</ref>. Both TAG
               and TAGML are designed to express and store textual features in a way that
               corresponds more closely with the scholar’s understanding of it. TAG’s functional
               design is based on the objective to reconcile the conceptual model, the encoding
               model and the informational model. The expressiveness of the syntax TAGML allows
               scholars to digitally represent their understanding of a text in a more explicit and
               formal manner. This information is then stored in the hypergraph data model for text.
               Consequently, a TAGML processor will not require any application layer in order for
               the text to be processed, queried, and analysed as it is intended and understood by
               the encoder. Finally, TAG’s approach will also promote the sustainability,
               archivability, and reuse of the text encoding. </p>
            <p>The textual examples used in this article come from modern manuscripts (i.e.,
               authorial holographs and drafts dating from the late nineteenth, early twentieth
               century) that are encoded from a genetic perspective on text, meaning that the
               encoder is interested in capturing the various textual revisions in great detail.
               This interest, combined with the type of manuscript material, presents the encoder
               with textual features that are notoriously complex to model in TEI XML: overlapping
               text structures, discontinuous text, and non-linear text are more rule than
               exception. After a brief description of the research objectives of the field followed
               by an illustration of three textual features, the article goes on to describe the
               main characteristics of the TAG model. The third and final section of the article
               addresses the theoretical and practical implications of using TAGML to express the
               example texts from the first section. By contrasting the TAG model with the TEI XML
               model, the article illustrates how a text encoded in TAGML is understood and
               processed in a way that is closer to the genetic scholar’s understanding of the text.

               <p>The field of textual genetic research is concerned with the way literary texts
                  originate and develop over time. To this end, draft manuscripts provide a great
                  source of information as the writings on these documents often reflect the
                  author’s train of thought: words are crossed out, sentences are added, paragraphs
                  transposed… In other words, draft manuscripts represent traces of a writing
                  process and by extension the creation and development of a literary work. Since
                  that’s exactly what textual genetic scholars intend to capture and study, it’s
                  important that information related to the writing process is expressed as detailed
                  as possible. Additionally, textual genetic editors set out to store and represent
                  the results of their research in such a way, that it can be explored by others.

               <p>In order to adequately represent and study a text’s genesis, editors typically (1)
                  express textual variation within one text; (2) map the relationships between texts
                  and documents related to the genesis of a text; and (3) compare textual variation
                  across documents; i.e., textual collation.<note>It’s not within the scope of this
                     article to survey describe this workflow in more detail, or to survey the
                     digital tools that support the activities within this scholarly
                     workflow.</note> A tool used to support either of these activities needs to
                  recognise the kind of information that is relevant for textual genesis and –
                  ideally – also ensure that this information is retained throughout the processing.
                  For example: if a tool ignores or discards the information about an author’s
                  revision process because it isn’t able to recognise the way this information is
                  encoded, it will have serious consequences for the analysis of the text’s genesis.
                  Incidentally, although we use examples from textual genetic studies throughout
                  this article, it may be noted that this principle applies to a wide variety of
                  text encoding and text processing.</p>

                     text as having multiple paths through a text: a sequence of words or characters

                     variation in the text occurs that join together again at the end of the
                     variation. The encoder can use markup in order to mark the location of the
                        <term>branching</term> of the text. The three figures below present cases of

                        corrections). The example in <ref target="immediate_del">figure 2</ref>
                        shows how Woolf started the sentence with the word <q>This</q> and
                        immediately corrected it to <q>The</q>. This means that there is no other
                        way of reading the text; no variant state that does not include the
                        revision, simply one path: <q>This The idea has grown...</q><figure

                     <p>We already saw an example of a grouped revision in the introduction; <ref
                           target="grouped_rev">figure 3</ref> represents another case: <q>for being
                           so certainly disagreeable</q>. The grouped revision is very similar to
                        the single deletion and the single addition: again, there are two ways of
                        reading the text, one including the word that has been deleted, and one
                        without that word and including the addition. However, in the case of a
                        grouped revision, scholars encode that the deletion and the addition belong
                        together semantically. In TEI XML this can be indicated by grouping them
                        with the <gi>subst</gi> element (see also the example in the introduction).
                        Conceptually, this implies that the order of the contents of the
                           <gi>subst</gi> element are placed is temporarily irrelevant. The two
                        words – <q>so</q> and <q>certainly</q> – alternate and are mutually
                        exclusive: whether we choose the original reading so or the corrected
                        reading certainly, they are at the same distance from the beginning of the
                           sentence.<figure xml:id="grouped_rev">

                     interesting case in which a narrator (Marion) cites a letter she has received.

                     sure to get everyone’s attention. As textual genetic scholars are equally
                     interested in both the material, documentary aspects as well as the sequential,
                     textual aspects of a given work, they are well familiar with the challenge of

                  <p>Taken together, the examples in this section show that in order to properly
                     support textual genetic analysis, then, a data model needs to understand that
                     information can be non-linear, discontinuous, or that it may have multiple,
                     co-existing structures. Evidently, this is not a novel conclusion: almost a
                     soon as the OHCO model of XML had been introduced to the text encoding
                     community, researchers have tried to come up with alternative data models that
                     would be a better fit for the notion of text as a multi-hierarchical (or
                     hierarchy-less) data structure.<note> Again, it’s not within the scope of the
                        present article to give a comprehensive overview of these alternative
                        models. Those interested in this discussion will find the work of Allen H.
                        Renear et al. a useful starting point, or to take a look at the MLCD Overlap
                        Corpus, which stems from the project Markup Languages for Complex Documents

               <p>Scholars have been working on topics like text modeling, text encoding, and markup
                  for decades, hence they are well-aware of the difficulties of representing complex
                  textual characteristics in an effective way. With <q>effective</q>, we mean
                     <q>with little to no additional workarounds or bespoke technical solutions</q>.
                  Because, as Fabio Vitali argued (<ref type="bibl" target="#vitali2016">Vitali
                     2016</ref>), one can theoretically use any datamodel to express any kind of
                  text, no matter how complex, as long as one is willing to use some workarounds, do
                  some extra coding, and handover certain tasks to other data formats. However, as
                  many have pointed out, TEI XML has a wide variety of different mechanisms to
                  express a textual feature, and no XML processor will be able to correctly
                  interpret these mechanisms unless it depends on a schema or some other document
                  that explains the intended meaning (among others, see <ref type="bibl"
                     target="#schmidt">Schmidt</ref>; <ref type="bibl" target="#sper2008"
                     >Sperberg-McQueen and Huitfeldt 2008</ref>; <ref target="#per2009" type="bibl"

                     Birnbaum 2017</ref>). In this contribution, we maintain the argument that the
                  more workarounds and handovers required, the more difficult it becomes to process
                  or query the text, and the less interchangeable or reuseable the encoded text
                  becomes.</p>
